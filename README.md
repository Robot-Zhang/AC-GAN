# AC-GAN
These are the supplementary materials of AC-GAN, which is a communication-efficient distributed training method for GANs over unreliable networks. 

There are five supplementary materials: 
  + A pdf file used to supplement the paper
  + Four gif files showing the training process of different algorithms.
  + The source code of our experiments (It will be uploaded after the paper is published).
